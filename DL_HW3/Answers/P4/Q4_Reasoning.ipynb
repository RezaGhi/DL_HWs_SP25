        "\n",
        "In this assignment, you will explore inference scaling techniques in large language models (LLMs) and evaluate their performance using the Math Benchmark. Throughout the notebook, you will learn about several inference methods, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** A method where the model generates intermediate reasoning steps before providing the final answer.\n",
        "- **Best-of-n Sampling:** An approach that generates multiple candidate responses and selects the best one based on a scoring function.\n",
        "- **Beam Search:** A technique that expands several possible sequences simultaneously, choosing the most promising ones based on probability.\n",
        "- **Self-Refinement:** An iterative process where the model revises its output to improve accuracy and coherence.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Math Benchmark** is a suite of challenging mathematical problems designed to test the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of LLMs. The benchmark includes a variety of questions ranging from basic arithmetic and algebra to more advanced topics such as geometry and calculus. For example, you might be asked to solve an equation like `2x + 5 = 15` or compute the derivative of a function, tasks that assess the model's ability to handle both straightforward and complex mathematical queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this assignment, you will have:\n",
        "- Gained a deeper understanding of inference time scaling methods in LLMs.\n",
        "- Compared the effectiveness of different inference techniques using a rigorous math evaluation framework.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's dive into the notebook and begin exploring how these methods perform on a challenging set of math problems!\n"

            "Alright, so I need to figure out how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has. Hmm, okay, let's start by recalling what a divisor is. A divisor of a number is another number that can divide into it without leaving a remainder. So, for example, the divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6 because each of these numbers can divide 6 evenly.\n",
            "\n",
            "But 196 is a bit larger, so I need a systematic way to find all its divisors. I remember that one way to find the number of divisors is to factorize the number into its prime factors and then use that to determine the number of possible combinations. Let me try that.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, I need to factorize 196. Let's see, 196 is an even number because it ends with a 6, so it's divisible by 2. Let me divide 196 by 2:\n",

If a number N can be expressed as N = p₁^a × p₂^b × p₃^c × ... where p₁, p₂, p₃, etc., are prime factors and a, b, c are their respective exponents, then the number of positive divisors of N is (a + 1)(b + 1)(c +\n",

I think it's something like the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in each coordinate. Yeah, that sounds right.

            "\n",
            "First, let me understand what the problem is asking. A perfect cube is a number that can be expressed as some integer raised to the power of three. So, numbers like 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, etc., are perfect cubes. The question is asking for the smallest one that can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers.\n",
            "\n",
            "Alright, so let's denote the three consecutive integers. Let me call them n, n+1, and n+2. So, their sum would be n + (n+1) + (n+2). Let me compute that: n + n + 1 + n + 2. That simplifies to 3n + 3, right? So, the sum is 3n + 3. Hmm, that can be factored as 3(n + 1). So, the sum is three times (n + 1). \n",
            "\n",
            "So, the sum of three consecutive integers is 3(n + 1). Now, the problem says this sum is a perfect cube. So, 3(n + 1) must be a perfect cube. Let me denote the perfect cube as k³, where k is some positive integer. So, 3(n + 1) = k³. Therefore, n + 1 = k³ / 3. Since n has to be an integer, k³ must be divisible by 3. \n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, so k³ is divisible by 3. That means that k itself must be divisible by 3, because if a prime number divides a cube, it must divide the base. So, 3 divides k, which implies that k is a multiple of 3. Let me write that as k = 3m, where m is an integer. \n",
            "\n",
            "Substituting back into the equation: 3(n + 1) = (3m)³. Let me compute that: 3(n + 1) = 27m³. So, dividing both sides by 3, we get n + 1 = 9m³. Therefore, n = 9m³ - 1. \n",
            "\n",
            "So, n is equal to 9m³ minus 1. Since n is an integer, m can be any integer. But we are looking for the smallest positive perfect cube. So, we need to find the smallest k such that k³ is positive and 3(n + 1) = k³. \n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, but k³ must be positive, so k must be positive. So, the smallest positive integer k is 1. Let me check if k=1 works. If k=1, then 3(n + 1) = 1³ = 1. So, n + 1 = 1/3. But n has to be an integer, so n + 1 = 1/3 is not possible. So, k=1 doesn't work.\n",

            "Next, try k=2. Then, 3(n + 1) = 8. So, n + 1 = 8/3, which is approximately 2.666... Not an integer. So, k=2 doesn't work either.\n",
            "\n",
            "Next, k=3. Then, 3(n + 1) = 27. So, n + 1 = 9. Therefore, n = 8. So, n is 8, which is an integer. Therefore, the sum of the three consecutive integers starting at 8 is 8 + 9 + 10 = 27, which is 3³. So, that works.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, but hold on. Is 27 the smallest positive perfect cube that can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers? Because when k=1, we couldn't find an integer n, and when k=2, we also couldn't. So, 27 is the next one. But let me just confirm.\n",
            "\n",
            "Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Let me think about the sum of three consecutive integers. As I did before, it's 3n + 3, which is 3(n + 1). So, 3(n + 1) is a perfect cube. So, 3(n + 1) = k³. So, n + 1 = k³ / 3. So, k³ must be divisible by 3, so k must be a multiple of 3, as I thought earlier.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, let me let k = 3m, so k³ = 27m³. Therefore, n + 1 = 9m³, so n = 9m³ - 1. So, for m=1, n=8, which gives the sum as 27. For m=2, n=9*8 -1=71, which gives the sum as 3*(71 +1)=216, which is 6³. So, 216 is the next one. \n",
            "\n",
            "So, 27 is the smallest one. But wait, is there a smaller cube? Let me think. The cubes are 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, etc. So, 1 is too small because 3(n +1)=1 implies n +1=1/3, which is not integer. 8 is next, but 8 is 2³. So, 3(n +1)=8, which gives n +1=8/3, which is not integer. So, 8 is out. Then, 27 is the next, which works. So, 27 is the smallest positive perfect cube that can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, but hold on. Let me check if 27 can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers. 8 + 9 + 10 is 27. So, yes, that works. So, 27 is the answer.\n",
            "\n",
            "But just to make sure I didn't miss anything, let me think if there's a way to get a smaller cube. The next cube is 64, which is 4³. Let's see if 64 can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers. So, 3(n +1)=64, so n +1=64/3≈21.333, which is not integer. So, no. Similarly, 125 is 5³. 3(n +1)=125, so n +1=125/3≈41.666, which is not integer. So, no. So, 27 is indeed the smallest.\n",
            "\n",
            "Alternatively, maybe I can think of it in another way. Let me denote the three consecutive integers as x, x+1, x+2. So, their sum is 3x + 3, which is 3(x +1). So, 3(x +1) must be a perfect cube. So, 3 divides the cube, so 3 divides x +1, which means x +1 is a multiple of 3. So, x +1=3k, so x=3k -1. Therefore, the three numbers are 3k -1, 3k, 3k +1. So, their sum is 3k -1 + 3k + 3k +1=9k. So, 9k is a perfect cube.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, 9k = m³, where m is an integer. So, k = m³ / 9. Therefore, m³ must be divisible by 9, so m must be divisible by 3, because 9 is 3². So, m=3n, so m³=27n³. Therefore, k=27n³ /9=3n³. So, k=3n³. Therefore, the three consecutive integers are 3k -1=9n³ -1, 3k=9n³, and 3k +1=9n³ +1. So, their sum is 9n³ -1 +9n³ +9n³ +1=27n³, which is a perfect cube.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, for n=1, the numbers are 8,9,10, which sum to 27. For n=2, they are 55,56,57, sum to 168, which is 5.544³, but that's not an integer cube. Wait, no, 27n³ when n=2 is 27*8=216, which is 6³. So, that's correct.\n",

            "Alright, so I'm looking at this math problem about a bake sale. The math club sold cookies, cupcakes, and brownies, and we need to find their profit after subtracting the baking costs. Let me break down how I approached this step by step.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, I started by understanding what the problem was asking. They sold different items at different prices, and we needed to calculate the total money they made and then subtract the cost to bake everything to find the profit. That makes sense because profit is usually calculated as total revenue minus total costs.\n",
            "\n",
            "Next, I looked at the number of each item sold and their respective prices. For the cookies, they sold 54 at a rate of 3 for $1. I thought about how to calculate the revenue from cookies. Since they sold them in sets of 3 for $1, I divided the total number of cookies by 3 to find out how many sets they sold. 54 divided by 3 is 18, so they sold 18 sets. Each set was $1, so the revenue from cookies is 18 times $1, which equals $18. That seems straightforward.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then, for the cupcakes, they sold 20 at $2 each. Multiplying 20 by $2 gave me $40. That part was simple too.\n",
            "\n",
            "For the brownies, they sold 35 at $1 each. So, multiplying 35 by $1 directly gave me $35. That was easy as well.\n",
            "\n",
            "After calculating the revenue from each item, I added them up to get the total revenue. $18 from cookies, $40 from cupcakes, and $35 from brownies. Adding those together, I got a total revenue of $93.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, the baking cost was $15. To find the profit, I subtracted the baking cost from the total revenue. So, $93 minus $15 equals $78. That seems correct.\n",
            "\n",
            "I double-checked my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Dividing 54 by 3 gives 18, and 18 times $1 is definitely $18. 20 times $2 is $40, and 35 times $1 is $35. Adding those up gives $93, and subtracting $15 from that gives $78. Everything adds up correctly.\n",
            "\n",
            "I also considered whether there might be any hidden costs or taxes that weren't mentioned, but the problem doesn't mention any, so I assumed the $15 was the total baking cost.\n",

            "Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the result of a 90-degree rotation around the origin in the counter-clockwise direction applied to the complex number 7 + 2i. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, I remember that rotating a complex number in the plane can be done using multiplication by another complex number. Specifically, a rotation by θ degrees can be represented by multiplying by e^(iθ). But wait, I think that's for radians. Since the problem says 90 degrees, maybe I should convert that to radians first? Let me check: 90 degrees is π/2 radians. So, e^(iπ/2) is a complex number on the unit circle at 90 degrees. I think that's equal to cos(π/2) + i sin(π/2), which is 0 + i*1, so just i. So, multiplying by i should give me a 90-degree rotation.\n",
            "\n",
            "But hold on, is that correct? Let me think. If I have a complex number z = a + bi, multiplying by i should rotate it 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Let me verify that. If I take z = 1, which is 1 + 0i, multiplying by i gives i, which is 0 + 1i, so that's a 90-degree rotation. If I take z = i, multiplying by i gives i^2, which is -1, so that's 180 degrees rotation. Wait, that's not 90 degrees. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, no. Let me think again. If I have z = 1, which is (1,0) in the complex plane, multiplying by i is equivalent to rotating 90 degrees counter-clockwise. So, 1 becomes i, which is (0,1). That's correct. If I take z = i, which is (0,1), multiplying by i gives i^2 = -1, which is (-1,0), a 180-degree rotation. Hmm, so maybe the formula is that multiplying by e^(iθ) is equivalent to rotating θ degrees. So, for θ = 90 degrees, that's e^(iπ/2) = i, which is correct. So, in that case, multiplying the complex number by i should give the 90-degree rotation.\n",
            "\n",
            "But wait, when I multiplied i by i, I got -1, which is a 180-degree rotation. So, perhaps I need to be careful. Let me think about the formula again. If I have a complex number z = a + bi, then multiplying by e^(iθ) gives z' = (a cosθ - b sinθ) + (a sinθ + b cosθ)i. So, for θ = 90 degrees, cosθ is 0 and sinθ is 1. So, plugging in, we get z' = (a*0 - b*1) + (a*1 + b*0)i = (-b) + ai. So, that's equivalent to multiplying by i, which is correct. So, in that case, the formula is z' = -b + ai.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, so if I have z = 7 + 2i, then a = 7 and b = 2. So, applying the formula, z' = -2 + 7i. So, is that the result? Let me check that again.\n",
            "\n",
            "Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a rotation matrix. A 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation matrix is [0, -1; 1, 0]. So, if I apply that to the vector (a, b), which is (7, 2), the new vector would be (0*7 - 1*2, 1*7 + 0*2) = (-2, 7). So, that's the same as -2 + 7i. So, that seems consistent.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier when I multiplied i by i, I got -1, which is a 180-degree rotation. So, is there a difference between multiplying by i once or twice? Because if I have z = i, multiplying by i again gives i^2 = -1, which is a 180-degree rotation. So, in that case, multiplying by i twice is equivalent to a 180-degree rotation. So, in general, multiplying by e^(iθ) is equivalent to a rotation of θ degrees. So, for θ = 90 degrees, it's e^(iπ/2) = i, so multiplying by i once gives a 90-degree rotation.\n",
            "\n",
            "But then, if I have z = 1, multiplying by i gives i, which is 90 degrees. If I have z = i, multiplying by i gives -1, which is 180 degrees. So, in that case, it's clear that multiplying by i once is 90 degrees, but multiplying by i twice is 180 degrees. So, in general, multiplying by e^(iθ) is a rotation of θ degrees.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, going back to the original problem, z = 7 + 2i. So, a = 7, b = 2. So, applying the rotation formula, z' = -b + ai = -2 + 7i. So, that should be the result.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, but let me double-check. Let me represent 7 + 2i as a vector (7, 2). Then, applying a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation, which should be equivalent to multiplying by i. So, in matrix terms, that's:\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "Wait, but let me think about another way. If I use the formula for rotation in complex numbers: z' = z * e^(iθ). So, z = 7 + 2i, θ = 90 degrees. So, e^(iθ) = cosθ + i sinθ = 0 + i*1 = i. So, z' = (7 + 2i) * i = 7i + 2i^2 = 7i - 2 = -2 + 7i. So, that's the same result.\n",

            "\n",
            "But cos(arctan(2/7) + 90°) is equal to -sin(arctan(2/7)), and sin(arctan(2/7) + 90°) is equal to cos(arctan(2/7)). So, the new complex number is sqrt(53) * (-sin(arctan(2/7)) + i cos(arctan(2/7))).\n",

So, sinθ = 2/sqrt(53), cosθ = 7/sqrt(53). Therefore, sin(arctan(2/7)) = 2/sqrt(53), cos(arctan(2/7)) = 7/sqrt(53).\n",
