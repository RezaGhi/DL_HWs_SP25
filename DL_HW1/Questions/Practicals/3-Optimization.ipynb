    "\n",
    "Now that we've discussed the general structure of our optimization function, let's explore how to implement a specific optimization method. In this section, we'll walk through the steps required to define an update rule for an optimizer. This involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Computing the Loss and its Derivatives:**  \n",
    "   We evaluate the loss function for the current parameters, compute the gradient, and optionally calculate the Hessian if using a second-order method.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Applying the Update Rule:**  \n",
    "   Based on the computed derivatives, we update the parameters using the specific logic of our chosen optimization method (e.g., adjusting the parameters using SGD, Adam, or Newton's method).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Maintaining State:**  \n",
    "   For methods that require momentum or other historical data, we update and maintain a state dictionary that carries this information from one iteration to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, we can iteratively update the parameters to minimize the loss function and analyze the optimization trajectory. Let's move on to see this process in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "# General Optimization Function Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The `optimize` function provides a unified framework for iterative optimization methods. Whether using first-order (gradient-based) or second-order (Hessian-based) methods, the overall process remains similar: we start with an initial guess for the parameters and then iteratively update these parameters in order to minimize a given loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - **Parameters:**  \n",
    "     The function receives an initial parameter tensor (`initial_params`). This tensor is cloned and set to require gradients so that we can compute derivatives with respect to it.\n",
    "   - **State Storage:**  \n",
    "     An empty dictionary `state` is initialized to store any additional information required by the update method (e.g., momentum for Adam, or curvature approximations for second-order methods).\n",
    "   - **Path Recording:**  \n",
    "     The initial parameters are stored in a list called `path`. This list will hold the parameter values after each iteration, allowing us to visualize the optimization trajectory later.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterative Update Process:**\n",
    "   - For each epoch (i.e., optimization step), the following steps occur:\n",
    "     1. **Loss Evaluation:**  \n",
    "        The loss function `loss_func` is evaluated at the current parameter values to determine how well the current parameters perform.\n",
    "     2. **Gradient Computation:**  \n",
    "        The gradient (first derivative) of the loss with respect to the parameters is computed using `loss.backward()`.  \n",
    "        - For **first-order methods**, only the gradient is used.\n",
    "        - For **second-order methods**, additional curvature information is needed.\n",
    "     3. **Hessian Computation (Optional):**  \n",
    "        If the `second_order` flag is set to `True`, the Hessian (matrix of second derivatives) is computed using PyTorch's `torch.autograd.functional.hessian`.  \n",
    "        This Hessian provides insight into the curvature of the loss surface and is useful for methods like Newton's method.\n",
    "     4. **Parameter Update:**  \n",
    "        The update function `update_func` is then called:\n",
    "        - For **first-order methods** (e.g., SGD, Adam):  \n",
    "          It is called with the current parameters, their gradient, the state, and hyperparameters.\n",
    "        - For **second-order methods** (e.g., Newton‚Äôs Method, L-BFGS):  \n",
    "          The computed Hessian is also passed.\n",
    "        This function returns updated parameter values and an updated state.\n",
    "     5. **Re-enable Gradient Tracking:**  \n",
    "        After the update, gradients are cleared and re-enabled for the next iteration.\n",
    "     6. **Path Recording:**  \n",
    "        The new parameters are added to the `path` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Return Value:**\n",
    "   - After completing all epochs, the function returns the `path` ‚Äî a list of parameter values at each iteration. This path can later be used to visualize the optimization trajectory (for example, by plotting the loss versus epochs or overlaying the path on the loss surface).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Underlying Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unified Structure:**  \n",
    "  All optimization methods follow a similar iterative procedure: compute the loss, compute the gradient (and optionally the Hessian), update the parameters, and record the progress.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **First-Order vs. Second-Order Methods:**  \n",
    "  - *First-Order Methods* use only the gradient information. Their update rule typically has the form:  \n",
